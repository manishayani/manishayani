### INTRODUCTION

Cyber Security has been an integral part of my learning sphere ever since I started my Masters at UTS. With "Summer Studio: CYBERSECURITY" I hope to take my understanding of this domain further. This course is aimed at giving students project-based learning experience with a focus on design thinking. Students are expected to work in teams and define problems, identify, develop, and implement solutions.


## EXPECTATIONS
Mr. Larry Zeckster, our subject tutor, has been very helpful in developing an understanding of what this subject is about. He has been very accessible and open in getting information about the course cycle and material required. Initial interactions with him have made me positive about a great learning experience in the duration of this course.

It is a real delight to see that UTS offers different studios like this that cater to a wide group of people with different interests and making them available to as many as possible.

I am looking forward to deciding about the field of Cybersecurity I want to pursue my career in and hope that by the end of this studio, I would have a clearer chain of thoughts on the same. 

With all the practical learning and project-based modules involved, I am very positive about developing an understating of how things work out in the industry and the tools used to accomplish those tasks. Since there will be various industry speakers and trainers throughout the duration, I am also hoping to grow my professional network as it might help me in finding better work opportunities down the line.


## REFLECTION
I have been a student at UTS for 3 semesters, and over the course of my stay, I have grown and learned more than I thought possible. I came to this university from India already knowing that I wanted to pursue my career in cybersecurity, but as the time passed on I became a bit confused on how to boost my career in Cybersecurity and what field should I choose. 

Enrolling for the summer studio has proved out a great decision for me. After attending first week classes I am confident on how to streamline myself. The tutors are very knowledgeable and helpful. I believe I will surely learn some hands-on skills in this subject that will take me one step closer towards the industry. There are also professionals from the industry. So far I feel my expectations have been met and I am happy to be a part of this studio.
