### INTRODUCTION
Week 3 of the Summer Studio was a little bit chilled out but Interesting. As a tradition of the subject, the class began with the Standup Meeting where everyone shared their strengths and weaknesses from last week. One of the most common weaknesses amongst all was management and communication within the group. This was also my weakness for the week. For the accomplishment, I spoke about how I feel confident about the reflection written for last week. Later on, Larry ran us through this week’s objective for the class and the first objective was to give a presentation on Thursday.

Problem Statement -> The more a web application is made interactive, the more it gets vulnerable to security breaches.

## Group Formation
We were again asked to form a group of 3 for the presentation to be given on Thursday. I quickly formed the group with the same guys from last week. But Jason, later on, pointed out that the group members should be different from those of last week. So, I started scouting for new group members. Thankfully, I was able to find new group members with reasonable ease. Next was deciding the topic of the presentation. We were asked to select a web-based attack and this time we had to show a live demo for it as well. The required length for presentation was 6 minutes, which I thought was enough for 3 members to present. For the topic, we decided on Syn Flooding Attack, which was denied by Max stating that it was a type of Network Attack. This helped me realize that Network Security and Web Security are two different fields in this Security domain. One of the benefits of enrolling into this subject is that you learn new things every day. Max suggested we have a look at OWASP top 10 for the top web attacks list. After going through the website, we then finalised on SQL Injection attack.

Like last week, each group member took one pointer to research and present on Thursday. Hayden, one of my group members created a presentation template on Canva, where we can all edit the slides and Dowsen, the other member of the group created the private group on Microsoft Teams for communication amongst the group.

## Presentations
On Thursday, we had to give our presentation on the topic of choice for Web Application Penetration. Our topic of the presentation was SQL Injection (SQLI). Out of all the topics in Web Application Penetration, I had some prior experience in this topic. I tried using SQL Injection on my School Website and was easily able to access the master student information database for the school. Subsequently, I informed the school’s IT department about the vulnerability and suggestions on patching it. That was my first interaction with web application penetration. Sadly my suggestions fell on deaf ears and even after all these years, that SQL vulnerability still exists.

Moving on, we gave an excellent presentation with a recorded demo on how to perform an SQLI. The only thing we lacked in our presentation was finishing the presentation on time i.e. 6 minutes. Our group was the only one amongst all who couldn’t finish the presentation on time. So I believe I need to work on my presentation skills.

Other groups also gave informative presentations on some very interesting topics including XSS, RFI and Security Misconfiguration. My knowledge on these topics has surely increased by listening to them. Our Subject Coordinator Roger Hadgraft was also present to see the presentations and he liked the fact that we included the “Acknowledgement of the country” slide. He was impressed by the way we presented.

## Web Application Penetration
Larry and Jason explained to us about Web app Penetration. This is one of the topics of my interests which enticed me to pursue a career in Cybersecurity. I had a very little experience of Web Application Penetration and that was when I attended a security workshop five years ago. I had no expectations on what we were going to do this week but was sure that it would be fun. Later on we practised on OWASP Juice Shop, which is a vulnerable web app created with the aim for teaching and learning. 

The aim for the web application penetration is to identify security weaknesses across Web Applications and exploit them. Usually Web Applications are prone to security breaches. Web Applications are being compromised on a regular basis and this is one of the reasons that makes adoption of web security all the more important.

The Cases of web security breaches have continuously increased over the past few years and is expected to grow even more. Below is the list of top 10 security vulnerabilities provided by OWASP

1. Injections
2. Broken Authentications
3. Sensitive Data exposure
4. XML External Entities (XXE)
5. Broken Access control
6. Security misconfigurations
7. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components with known vulnerabilities.
10. Insufficient logging and monitoring

Users on the other hand could use the following preventive measures to be safe on the Internet. These include:

1. Using Https websites instead of http website
2. Not Downloading files from unknown sources
3. Avoiding clicking on unknown links
4. Not Using anyone else's device to go online
5. Be alert to scams and phishing emails.

## OWASP Juice Shop
The OWASP Juice shop is a vulnerable web application created by OWASP for education and training purposes. This application is written in JavaScript which makes it vulnerable. There are many vulnerabilities associated with JavaScript, one of them being XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). Javascript is used in Web Application to provide interactive user experience but it can also be used to run malicious scripts on users' systems whenever a user visits the webpage.

## Bandit Wargame
Bandit is a wargame which is for beginners to increase their linux commands skills. This game is the first step for other high level war games. This game was advised by the tutor to improve command skills and get a little hands-on on linux terminal. I am currently on level 15 and aim to finish this game by the end of next week.

## Things that went good this week
1. Nvidia with Kali
Even after deciding not to try anymore of nvidia with kali, I still gave it one more shot and tried to install Nvidia drivers on Kali. I followed the official guide and executed everything slowly and calmly. After waiting a while I was successful in installing drivers.(A sigh of relief).

2. Confident around linux shell and commands
After spending most of my time this week on Bandit and OWASP Juice Shop, I am much more comfortable with Linux and Terminal.

3. Clear Understanding of Linux File System
To have a better understanding of linux commands, I thought that I should have a clear understanding of Linux File System and how data is stored in them. So I happen to watch a few youtube videos and now I have a better understanding of the file system.

## Challenges Faced
1. Time Management remains my major concern for the week. I am trying to put my full efforts into the subject and I believe I am gaining knowledge as well but I am wasting a lot of time. The work which should have been done in an hour, I am taking 3-4 hours for that. So I genuinely need to get my time management skills in order.

2. One of the reasons for wasting time is that I am procrastinating and delaying work too much. Since the deadline for all the work is on every week’s sunday, I procrastinate work and then struggle at the end moment.

## Goals for the next week
The Goal for next week is to bring in order my time management skills and not delaying work and doing it as soon as possible.

Also, by the end of next week, my goal is to finish bandit and then start with natas or any other suitable tool.
