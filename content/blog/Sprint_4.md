### INTRODUCTION
Week 4 was an overwhelming week for me, we dived into Boot2Root, a topic in cybersecurity. But for the start, the class began with the standup meeting. Some common weaknesses students discovered were lack of the knowledge of the subject and Procrastination. This was even my problem as well but I believed this week I tried to improve upon it.

Problem Statement -> “ Although after so much of advancement in the technology, Security issues remain the major problem for the organisation and continues to affect the stakeholders the most”

## Boot2Root
After the Standup Meeting, we started on with this week contents and the topics were Boot2Root. I had no experience of Boot2Root and didn’t know what it is, but the name seems nice and interesting. Boot to Root is Vulnerable machines created for the purpose of these machines are to test and increase the network security skills of a user. The aim of these challenges is to gain admin privileges by trying a different set of skills. The tutors showed us a live demo on a vulnerable VM known as “Wakanda”. This VM was available of VulnHub. VulnHub is a repository which contains vulnerable VMs. There were different steps involved such as scanning ports, executing reverse shell etc. I was really confused the first time they showed the demo but gradually everything got set into places.

Different VM’s have their own set of vulnerabilities and different ways to exploit it, but the basic idea underlying is the same and that is to gain access to the shell. Once access to the shell is achieved, the attacker can try to escalate the privileges to obtain full control of the Operating System. Sometimes the shell is behind the Firewalls or IDS, where direct access to the shell is not possible, in that case, a reverse shell is used to gain access to the shell.

## BSides 2020
While having a chat with Larry during the class, he told me about BSides 2020. BSides is an international security conference, to be held in Canberra this year. I researched it a little bit and found that it a kind of big deal in the Information security domain. Larry told us it is a good place to be and also to network with industry professionals. I checked on the guest speakers list, there are some amazing people attending this year and with very interesting topics. I am planning to go to the conference, once I sought out my autumn semester timetable.

## Bug Bounty Program
I have been hearing so much about bug bounty programs from the past two weeks which made me look into it. I have heard about Bug Bounties before but did not have much knowledge about it. Bug Bounties is a kind of deal offered to individuals to receive recognition and compensation offered by many organisations for reporting bugs and especially security vulnerabilities. Bug Bounty programs are becoming very popular due to the increase in the number of cybercrime cases. Even companies such as Microsoft, Mozilla, Google, Yahoo etc are also implementing Bug Bounties Program. This is comparatively a cheaper way for organisations to secure their product rather than hiring white-hat hackers to penetrate the system. For individuals, these programs are a great learning experience and I will surely consider this to pursue as my side career.

## Virtual Internships @ InsideSherpa
A few days back, I got to know about an online platform, Insidesherpa which offers Virtual Internships. Upon looking into it I found a cybersecurity Virtual Internship program offered by ANZ Corporation. This is around a 6-hour program which includes performing different tasks to complete it. The First task is to read different emails provided and identify if these are a threat or not. So far this virtual internship looks good. I’ll try to finish it coming week if time is available. I believe these platforms are great for students who do not have any work experience and are looking for industrial exposure. Also being an international student is difficult to secure a job or internship, so this could be a starting point.

## Mr Robot CTF
MR Robot is a vulnerable machine, available on VulnHub. This game is based on the popular Tv show Mr Robot. The aim of the game is to find three keys hidden at different locations. As the game progresses, the difficulty level of the game increases.

## Challenges Faced

1. Windows Keyboard not working : 
One of the challenges I faced was My laptop’s keyboard wasn't working. Everything was working fine until I saw an update for Windows. As I was not doing anything important, I updated my system at that moment. The System got updated and when I tried to log in, the keyboard was not working. I thought maybe there is a driver issue, so I used the onscreen keyboard, typed in my password and installed the keyboard driver from the official website, but it didn't work. I even tried getting the driver from the driver pack solutions, that didn't work either. Now, I opened up a youtube video and looked for a solution. There was one video that said to delete some keys in the registry editor, I know it was risky but anyway I tried it. I followed all the steps and ended up in corrupting windows.

2. Not able to dedicate enough time to the subject : 
Sometimes I feel, due to my other commitments, I am unable to dedicate enough time for the subject. Due to which, I am always late at submissions and quality of work is being compromised. I need to dedicate enough time for the subject so that I can understand the topic well.

3. Bandit not complete
Though I planned to complete Bandit this week and start with Natas for the next week, I was unable to complete it as other work came up. I’ll try to complete this challenge as soon as possible.

## Goals for the Next Week

1. I’ll try to dedicate more time to the subject
2. Speeding up a little as I am taking a lot of time
