## Introduction
The Summer Studio Journey was exciting and fruitful. I certainly believe that my skills have improved and now I have better clarity of thoughts. During the start, I was confused if choosing this subject is the right thing for me or not, but eventually, as the subject progressed, it became exciting and intense. This subject was different from other subjects that I took in previous semesters. I feel that other subjects were more theoretical, and the course structure was not updated. In contrast, in this subject, everything was based on hands-on learning, and I could feel the contents of this subject to be current and relevant to the industry. I would like to thank all the tutors Larry, Jason and Max, who made this journey smooth and insightful.

## Achieving the SLOâ€™s

## 0. Engage with stakeholders to identify the problem
During the span of this subject, I had learnt an enormous amount of things in regards to the Security Domain. This learning wouldn't have been possible by engaging with the industrial professionals who helped me define my problem statement. There were many industry professionals that I was able to talk including
Patrick Kelso (UTS IT Security Team)
Robert Mitchell (Gitlab)
Nathan and Pieter (Deloitte Cyber Attack and Response Team)

Conversing with them was one of the best parts of the studio. Listening to their experience and early days in the security field gave me a new perspective of Cyber Security. Also, some tips and tricks they shared with us, I believe it would help procure me a job in the security domain.

 Problem Statement -> 'Even after so much advancement in the technology, security is one of the major concern amongst the organisation and continues to affect the stakeholders the most.'

Security Concerns is one of the major concerns for top management even after the IT industry has progressed rapidly. New vulnerabilities keep on coming up and continue to affect the market. Vulnerabilities can be due to Human error, programming error or restricted resources. 


## 2. Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem

During the time at summer studio, design thinking was used quite often, and I think I was able to use it effectively while solving boot2root challenges. Solving boot2root challenges and solving vulnerable VMs gave me much knowledge about the systems and what consequences have to be bear if the vulnerabilities are not patched. This design thinking was very new to me, but slowly and gradually, I got the gist of it.

The starting steps remain the same for every design that is to gather information using different tools such as Nmap, for scanning ports, nikto to exploit common vulnerabilities, go buster to get the subdirectories etc. Later on, the steps in each machine differ based on the configuration of the machine. But the ultimate goal remains the same that is to gain root access.


## 3. Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design

As this was a technical subject using technical skills was the primitive thing. Throughout the studio, I used a lot of technical expertise, and I believe my skills have improved to a great extent. Starting with setting up git and Hugo, a totally new topic for me, I did hear of git before but never felt like using it. At the start of this subject, I started by setting up a git account. It was so confusing, and I couldn't figure out the need for it. After watching videos over the internet, it became quite understandable. After that Hugo and using markdown language, honestly, till date I am not a fan of Hugo I personally feel that it adds more work instead of reducing it, I believe using HTML was better. Eventually, Hugo converts the markdown syntax into markup language, so it is better to use the markup language itself. But as this was the requirement of the subject, I learned it and anyways it adds one more language to your skillset.

The one technical skill that I believe I am good at and demonstrated conclusively throughout this studio is Web Search. The ability to find a particular query and apply solutions correctly is also a high technical skill. Most of the time, we were required to find one specific exploit from the internet and use them to access the server.

As the week progressed, I became more and more confident with my Linux terminal skills which I practised on Bandit and Natas wargames. Then, later using all the pentest tools, some of them I was familiar with, and some were very new to me. Tools such as Nmap, hydra and nikto are easy to understand, and I knew these in advance whereas tools such as Metasploit, john and cURL, I had no idea about these and got surprised about the capabilities of these tools.


## 4. Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

Collaboration and communication was a big challenge for me, as it is not my comfort zone. I like working alone, no matter how long the work is. But as the studio progressed, I felt the need to come out of my comfort zone and form groups to enrich my learning experience. Each week we formed different groups and presented on various topics. Starting from the second week, we had to perform on a Reconnaissance tool, so we showed a Nikto Vulnerability Scanner. 
In the third week, we presented on the  SQL injection attack, with a live demo. During last week we gave on cracking a live machine in the Summer Studio Showcase with a live demo. My presentation skills were weak before the start of the studio, and now I feel there is a lot of improvement in it. During the initial presentation, there was very little communication between team members; everybody just prepared their part and presented. In the later submissions, the communication amongst group members became smooth, and the quality of work also increased.

Apart from the presentation, I collaborated with other peers during solving boot2root challenges. I helped Jiahao for setting up an open VPN properly. Also, Aryan and I were solving the Deloitte VM together.

All the communication took place through teams app. We used to share a deadline one day before presentation or submissions to complete the assigned part, and almost all were able to finish their part by then. Now that the studio has finished I realise that it was not much of an effort to collaborate with others, I was just being lazy and kept on procrastinating it.

## 5. Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation.

Self Analysis is fundamental to know what went wrong. As a part of weekly submissions, we were asked to write reflections. During the start, I wouldn't say I liked the idea of it and did only as an obligation. But during week 3, I realised that it is essential to write reflections, it helps you remember things and clears your thoughts. Also, writing reflections helps you in improving your thinking capability.

Another indicator of performance evaluation was the feedback provided by the tutor every week. I have received both positive and negative feedback from the tutor and based on that, I have channelised myself. The feedback provided by the tutors were honest and without any partiality. It is always good to get a third person's view of your work to analyse your performance.

Lastly, during the class, We use to have standup meetings where we shared our challenges, things went well and goals for the week. This helped me organise the work. Some common problems faced by students were time management and frustration when solving boot 2 Root Challenges. I also worked on my challenges to better myself. Some issues are still there; I guess that is for me to address in future.

## TraverXec

This week, I tried cracking one more live machine on hack the box. The machine was named TraverXec, based on Linux and had an easy difficulty level. It took me some time to get the user access, but after that, I got the root access in no time.

## Conclusion

Enrolling into Summer Studio 2020: Cyber Security - An Offensive Mindset was an outstanding decision. I certainly feel having more knowledge about how the industry works. I cannot thank enough to all the tutor, Larry, Jason and Max, without their help and guidance, the studio would not have been possible. The learning journey has been quite intense and insightful. The subject contents were current and practical. I liked the logical progression of the class, i.e. in week 1 setting up the static site, then getting into reconnaissance tool, and later learning about attacks and finally getting into the action with boot2root challenges. I wish this subject could be offered in other semesters as well so as other students can also be benefited by it.
