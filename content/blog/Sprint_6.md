## INTRODUCTION
The last week of the summer studio was in continuation with the last two week's topic that is boot2root. We just had a class on Monday as on Thursday we had a formal presentation. The class began with the agenda for week 6 and then agenda for Thursday's Presentation. We did have ou last standup meeting in which other students talked about how they feel more confident about the boot2root and writeups. Some common weaknesses observed were frustration and staying late up at night to solve boot to root challenges.

## OPEN ADMIN
Last week I began with boot2root challenge on Hackthebox with OpenAdmin. Open Admin was a good live machine to solve. I certainly feel that my skills and knowledge have improved. Until last week, I was able to get the user access on the box, continuing the same on this week I was able to get the root access on the machine.

## PRESENTATION
For Thursday’s presentation, we had to present on one of the boxes and solving it, It was a group presentation so I teamed up with Aryan and Jiahao. We decided to present on TraverXec, another box available on HackTheBox. We started with TraveXec in the class itself and was solving it. We were helping each other wherever we faced problems. We were able to get a remote shell by the end of the class. After the class was over, we decided on to communicate over teams and finish this thing by Wednesday. We shared all the steps for solving the challenge and then Aryan took the responsibility to make a video of it.

## Summer Studio Showcase
I was really excited for the showcase. The showcase was scheduled in Building 2 where our first class was held. The showcase would start from 1 pm and run till 4 pm but the students were asked to come at 10 am in order to set up their presentation. During the start, the room was filled with students from all the studios with their respective models and presentations. It was quite a nice vibe.

As our group’s presentation video was ready we took only 5 minutes to set up the video. We went through a test run to see if it’s not getting boring or lengthy but hopefully, everything looked good. The presentation went really good and I felt that other students liked our presentation and were taking interest in it. Some students also asked questions such as where did you find the code for XSS and how long did it take you to break in and if it is legal to break in these machines. I also presented to some of the tutors from the subjects I took in previous semesters and they were impressed by the presentation.

I also got a chance to look at other students work. Their work was remarkable and thoughtful. Some projects which I really liked was, making a stock market prediction system using Data Analysis. They used Python to program it and used one month’s data as an input. Thinking about the practical applications of it I felt that this was one of the most innovative projects of the studio this year.

Another project which I liked was creating a system to detect the direction of a moving car. This project was also built using the python programming language. I thought of this as a very useful project for Traffic police to detect traffic offenders. There were other great projects as well. Majority of the technical projects were built in Python which made me think how great and powerful python can be. Python is also used in cybersecurity for scripting and I might get into it very soon.

To Conclude, the showcase was a hit. I feel I have learned a lot from it. I am happy for myself and all the other students. Now, I have some clarity of thoughts on what next I need to do in my career. Also after seeing other students projects motivated me to explore more in this field.

## CHALLENGES FACED
1. Following the Schedule: Even though I created a work schedule for me, I was unable to follow it. This happened because some things took more time than the time allocated to it.
2. Creating an Impression: During the showcase, I felt that other students and staff did not come to our table as much as they did on other stalls. So I feel we lacked in creating an opening impression.

## FUTURE GOALS
Now that the classes have finished I thought of setting some future goals
1. Keep Continuing on boot 2 Root machines
2. Getting involved in more group work
3. Learning Python, as it looks like it will be advantageous for my career
