## INTRODUCTION
Another Interesting week of the Summer Studio - Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset. This week we continued with Boot2Root as it a vast topic and requires more time for it. After starting this topic last week and solving one challenge last week, I am getting familiar with these challenges and I feel one step closer towards the industry. I believe if I continue to do these challenges I would land myself in a good cybersecurity job. The class began with the startup meetings, some strengths that other students said were gaining more familiarity with the topics and becoming more confident with Boot2Root machines. Some weaknesses that students faced were getting frustrated and lack of knowledge with the subject and patience level. These were my weaknesses as well and I should start planning to deal with it.

## Hack The Box
This week we started with Hack the Box. Hack the box is an online platform that allows individuals to test their skills and try to break into Vulnerable live machines. It is a great platform to improve hacking skills while having fun. It follows a ranking and gives you points whenever you compromise a machine. There are different challenges based on the level of difficulty, you can choose based on your knowledge. The website also has a large forum where you can exchange ideas, questions and suggestions.

To connect to hack the box and solve challenges, you need to download OpenVPN and configuration file available on the website itself.

## The Invite Challenge
At the start of the Hack the Box, you are greeted with an invite challenge. Upon solving that challenge, you get an Invite code which will allow you to register an account. Solving this challenge is tricky. During my first encounter with the challenge, I didnâ€™t know that there is a challenge which needed to be solved in order to gain access. I thought it was paid account and the invitation code is generated only when we pay for the account. Later, when in the class, the tutor told us that this is a challenge which has to be solved. So then I realised and started with the challenge.

## Insights from the Deloitte Cyber Attack and Response Team

1. This week we had a guest lecture from two industry professionals working at Deloitte. Nathan and Pieter started by explaining to us what actually penetration testing is. 
2. They told us about three different security domains namely, Physical, Human and Cyber and their importance
3. The speakers stated that in order to avoid any security compromise, we need to think like the attacker
4. They also discussed the structure of a penetration test which involves a series of steps from Scoping to Reporting.
5. One of the interesting topics which I really liked was Red Teams Operations. A Red Team is a group of professional pen testers that assess the security of the organisation. The difference between normal penetration testing and red team operation is that, in Red Team operation, only a few people from the organisation have knowledge about the Red Team Operating. It is basically a simulation of an actual attack that an organisation might face and their response towards it. Whereas in normal penetration testing, all the people in the organisation is quite aware of pen-testers operating, so the organisation might take it causally. Penetration testing is scope based whereas red teams aim at compromising the system by any means.

## Deloitte VM
We were presented with a Virtual machine, created by Deloitte professionals. We were required to find and exploit the vulnerabilities in the VM aiming to gain the root access. The Deloitte professionals were there to guide and help us reach further. The VM looked like it was built upon Linux.

## OpenAdmin VM
OpenAdmin is a Linux Box available on Hack the Box Platform. The difficulty level of this VM is easy. This is the first machine of 2020 provided by Hackthebox. I have also started with the machine and so far I was able to get the user access.

## Challenges Faced This Week
1. Frustration - While doing Boot 2 Root Challenges and exploiting VMs, there were times when I got stuck and was unable to proceed further. During these times I got frustrated and started looking at the writeups. I should really try to avoid these things to become a successful Cybersecurity professional.

2. Time Management - Even after all these weeks, time management is still an issue for me. I had given this subject proper time but I end up wasting time on silly things. 

## Reflecting Upon Feedback
After submitting the last Reflection for Sprint 3 & 4, I received positive feedback from the tutor. There were two things that were said for the scope of improvement which includes more collaborative work improving Technical writeup skills. For the collaboration, this week I communicated with other guys as much as I could and solved challenges together. Sometimes I tried helping them where they got stuck and received the same from them. For the Deloitte VM also, I and Aryan were solving the VM together and were helping each other. 

For the writeups, I saw 2-3 different writeups and tried to improve upon it in this week's deliverable. I have written writeup in a clear and structured format, that is easily understandable to a person with a non-technical background.

## Goals for the next week
Since I am much more confident with the steps involved in penetrating a system and tools used in it, my goal is to try as many Vulnerable VM and try penetrating it. Also, By the end of next week, I aim to finish 1 more Vulnerable VMs.

Also, now that I am getting better at Boot to root challenges, I need to improve efficiency for solving these challenges. I will try to solve challenges as quickly as possible with increasing level of difficulty. I believe this is one of those things that will build my skills and will make me stand out from others.
