## INTRODUCTION
Another Interesting week of the Summer Studio - Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset. This week we continued with Boot2Root as it a vast topic and requires more time for it. After sarting this topic last week and solving one challenge last week, I am getting familiar with these challenges and I feel one step close towards the insdustry. I believe if I continue to do these challenges I would land myself in a good cybersecurity job. The class began with the startup meetings, some strengths that other people said were gaining more familiarty with the topics and becoming more confident with Boot2Root machines. Some weaknesses that students faced were getting frustrated and lack of knoweledge with the subject and patience level. These were my weaknesses as well and I will make sure to deal with it.

## Hack The Box
This week we started with Hack the Box. Hack the box is an online platform that allows individuals to test their skills and try to break into Vulnerable live machines. It is a great platform to increase hacking skills while having fun. It follows a ranking and gives you points whenever a machine is compromised. There are different challenges based on the level of difficulty, you can choose based on your knowledge. The website also has a large forum where you can exchange ideas, questions and suggestions. To connect to hack the box and solve challenges, you need to download OpenVPN and configuration file available on the website itself.

## The Invite Challenge
At the start of the Hack the Box, you are greeted with an invite challenge. Upon solving that challenge, you get an Invite code which will allow you to register an account. Solving this challenge is tricky. During my first encounter with the challenge, I didnâ€™t know that there is a challenge which needed to be solved in order to gain access. I thought it was paid account and the invitation code is generated only when we pay for the account. Later, when in the class, the tutor told us that this is a challenge which has to be solved. So then I started with the challenge.

## Insights from the Deloitte Cyber Attack and Response Team

## Deloitte VM
We were presented with a Virtual machine, created by Deloitte professionals. We were required to find and exploit the vulnerabilities in the VM aiming to gain the root access. The Deloitte professionals were there to guide and help us in reaching the next step. The VM looked like it was built upon Linux.

## OpenAdmin VM
OpenAdmin is a Linux Box available on Hack the Box Platform. The difficulty level of this VM is easy. This is the first machine of 2020 provided by Hackthebox. I have also started with the machine and so far it is going good.

## Challenges Faced This Week
1. Frustration - While doing Boot 2 Root Challenges and exploiting VMs, there were times when I got stuck and was unable to proceed further. During these times I got frustrated and started looking at the writeups.

2. Time Management - After all 

## Reflecting Upon Feedback
After submitting the last Relection for Sprint 3 & 4, I recieved a positive feedback from the tutor. There were two things that were said to me which included more colaborative work and to improve writeup skills. For the collaboration I tried to work with other guys and solve challenges together. For the Deloitte VM also, Me and Aryan were solving the VM together and were helping each other. For the writeups, I saw 2-3 different writeups and tried to improve upon it in this week. I have written in clear and in well structured format, that is easily understandable to a person with non technical background.

## Goals for the next week
Since I am much more confident with the steps involved in penetrating a system and tools used in it, my goal is to try as many Vulnerable VM and try penetrating it. Also, By the end of next week, I aim to finish 2 more Vulnerable VMs.

Also, now that I am getting better at Boot to root challenges, I need to improve efficiency for solving these challenges. I will try to solve challenges as quickly as possible with increasing level of difficulty. I believe this is one thing that will help me in getting a job easily.
