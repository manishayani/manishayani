### Nikto Vulnerability Scanner

## INTRODUCTION
Nikto is an open Source, web scanning tool which performs multiple tests against web servers for nearly around 6700 vulnerabilities. This tool is created in Perl language which makes it platform independent tool. Any Operating system with Perl installed can run Nikto. Although this tool is pre-installed in Kali Linux. This tool is capable of scanning SSL websites, proxies, host authentication, IDS evasion etc. making it an ideal tool. Nikto also supports multiple plugins that extend the capabilities of the tools.

##INFORMATION GATHERED
Nikto is a powerful tool which can extract some very meaningful information from the web server. Server details such as what type of server is running (Nginx, Apache) or checking configuration of the server including multiple index files, backup files is possible with Nikto.

## RELEVANCE TO THE INDUSTRY
The large number of tests for both security vulnerabilities and mis-configured web servers makes it a go to tool for many security professionals and systems administrators. It can find forgotten scripts and other hard to detect problems from an external perspective.
Since Nikto is an open source tool with a lot of power, it is widely used in the industry. The tool is structured with plugins, therefore extending the capabilities. The plugins are frequently updated with new security checks.

## IMPACT OF THE TOOL
Due to the number of security checks that this tool performs a scan can take 45 mins or even longer, depending on the speed of your web server.Nikto does quite well in detecting web server configurations that return HTTP 200 OK on actual "page not found" results. Since Nikto is checking hundreds of URL's for the presence of old scripts, vulnerable applications and other problems. This can sometimes result in many false positives if the detection of the 404 -> 200 is not discovered by Nikto.
