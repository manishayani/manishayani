title   : Why Am I Different
description: >
  
  I grew up in India where I did my schooling and Bachelors in Computer Applications with Majors in Software Development. Through the duration of my Bachelors, I was actively indulged in many projects and cultural programs at the university. This immensely helped me to build a holistic view of how technology has touched every corner of our lives. What followed next was a paranoia surrounding the security of all my devices and the data on them. Thus I began growing keen towards Cyber Security. As a result, I decided to pursue my Masters in the same. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Information Technology from University of Technology Sydney with majors in Cybersecurity and Internetworking.
